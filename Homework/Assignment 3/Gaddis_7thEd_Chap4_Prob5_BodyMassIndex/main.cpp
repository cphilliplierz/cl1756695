 * Purpose: Gaddis 7th Edition Chapter 4 Problem 4 Area of Rectangle 
 * Created on July 7, 2014, 11:32 AM
 * 5. Body Mass Index
 * Write a program that calculates and displays a person s body mass index (BMI). The
 * BMI is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight
 * or underweight for his or her height. A person's BMI is calculated with the following
 * formula:
 * BMI = weight Ã— 703 / height^2
 * where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches. The program
 * should display a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight, is underweight,
 * or is overweight. A sedentary person's weight is considered to be optimal if his
 * or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered
 * to be underweight. If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered
 * to be overweight.
