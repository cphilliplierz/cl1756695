 * Purpose: Gaddis 7th Edition Chapter 4 Problem 6 Mass and Weight  
 * Created on July 7, 2014, 11:32 AM
 * Scientists measure an object's mass in kilograms and its weight in newtons. If you
 * know the amount of mass that an object has, you can calculate its weight, in newtons,
 * with the following formula:
 * Weight = mass Ã— 9.8
 * Write a program that asks the user to enter an object's mass, and then calculates and
 * displays its weight. If the object weighs more than 1,000 newtons, display a message
 * indicating that it is too heavy. If the object weighs less than 10 newtons, display a
 * message indicating that the object is too light.
